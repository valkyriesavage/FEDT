V1 3d printing automated pipeline
Experiment: basic example: measure shrinkage in 3d printed artefacts dependent of layer height and material across cubes of various sizes. 
Input: parametric geometry (specify cube side length) or specified stl file.
Unique labelling of input geometry files for each sliced instance using FreeCAD.  
Slicing automation based on Prusa slicer, parameterised by config.ini and CLI flags( as used in Slic3r). As seen in objectify. 
Variables: material, layer height. Illustrate parameterising of 'autogenerated' machine files by infill pattern and layer height.
Null hypothesis signifance testing using TEA as a black-box solution with fake-measurements provided in the .csv file.

Not including global vars, semi-structured logging at each block of the pipeline. Slicing adaptation for cura yet to be fixed.
Examples of output from labelling and slicing in the models dir.
